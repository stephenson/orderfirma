OrderFirma
==========

<b>This is not a Firmafon product, but a open source demo project on how to use our API and integrate a external service. You can use the demo, but with no support</b>

OrderFirma displays orders from Order Desk in Firmafon when you receive a call. It uses [Order Desk's API](http://kb.orderdesk.me/introduction-to-the-api/) and [Firmafon's iFrame API](https://dev.firmafon.dk/iframe/).

[Try it out right now](https://orderfirma.herokuapp.com/)

This is a demo of how you can easily create your own integrations to Firmafon and let others use it. You are welcome to use the Order Desk integration, but I recommend that you host it yourself, you can easily deploy it to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) with this button:
